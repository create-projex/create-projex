# Getting Started with Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a modern static site generator that's been gaining a lot of traction in the web development community, and for good reason. It promises to deliver fast, content-focused websites with minimal JavaScript by default.

## What Makes Astro Special?

### üöÄ Zero JavaScript by Default
Astro ships zero JavaScript to the client by default. This means your sites load incredibly fast because there's no unnecessary JavaScript bundle to download and execute.

### üèùÔ∏è Islands Architecture
When you do need interactivity, Astro uses an "Islands Architecture" where you can selectively hydrate individual components, keeping the rest of your page static.

### üîß Bring Your Own Framework
You can use components from React, Vue, Svelte, and more - all in the same project!

## Setting Up Your First Astro Project

Let's create a new Astro project from scratch:

```bash
# Create a new project
npm create astro@latest my-astro-site

# Navigate to the project
cd my-astro-site

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

Here's what your Astro project structure looks like:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/        # Page layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/          # File-based routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/         # CSS and styling files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ content/        # Content collections (optional)
```

## Creating Your First Component

Astro components use a syntax similar to JSX, but with some key differences:

```astro
---
// Component Script (runs at build time)
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
---

<!-- Component Template -->
<div class="greeting">
  <h1>{greeting}</h1>
  <p>Welcome to {currentYear}!</p>
</div>

<style>
  .greeting {
    text-align: center;
    color: #333;
  }
  
  h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
  }
</style>
```

## Content Collections

One of Astro's most powerful features is Content Collections, which provide type-safe content management:

```typescript
// src/content/config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog };
```

## Adding Interactivity

When you need client-side interactivity, you can use the `client:*` directives:

```astro
---
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
---

<html>
  <body>
    <!-- This component will be hydrated on page load -->
    <Counter client:load />
    
    <!-- This component will be hydrated when visible -->
    <Counter client:visible />
    
    <!-- This component will be hydrated on user interaction -->
    <Counter client:idle />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Performance Benefits

Here's why Astro sites are so fast:

1. **Minimal JavaScript**: Only ship what you need
2. **Optimized builds**: Automatic code splitting and optimization
3. **Fast loading**: Static HTML loads instantly
4. **SEO friendly**: Perfect for search engines

## When to Use Astro

Astro is perfect for:

- ‚úÖ Blogs and documentation sites
- ‚úÖ Marketing websites
- ‚úÖ E-commerce sites
- ‚úÖ Portfolios

It might not be the best choice for:

- ‚ùå Highly interactive web applications
- ‚ùå Real-time applications

## Conclusion
